# Logistic Queue Planner

## Project Description

This project is designed to help a logistics company manage its transportation queue. It features a user-friendly interface that displays a list of deliveries for customers and a planner for scheduling these deliveries.

On the left side of the interface, you'll find a table with the list of deliveries for customers. This table includes the following details:

- Customer ID
- Customer Name
- Pick Up Location
- Drop Off Location

On the right side, there's a planner that shows the date and slots available for deliveries. The planner displays 7 days starting from the current date and includes 4 slots per day:

- Slot 1
- Slot 2
- Slot 3
- Slot 4
- Slot 5

The key feature of this application is the ability to drag customers from the Logistic Queue to the planner for each slot. This makes it easy to schedule deliveries by simply dragging and dropping the customers into the desired slots on the planner.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

## Usage

To use the application, simply drag a customer from the Logistic Queue and drop it into a slot on the planner. The customer's delivery will then be scheduled for that slot.
